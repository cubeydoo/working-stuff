Q: Is one GrowList implementation always better than the others?
A: GrowList is always best.

Q: Why is the runtime for N insertions into a geometrically resizing list a Theta(N) operation?
A: There is a 1 cost for each insertion, totaling Theta(n).

Q: Why is the runtime for N insertions into a arithmetically resizing list a Theta(N^2) operation?
A: Each insertion costs Theta(N), multiplied by Theta(N) is Theta (N^2).

Q: How does the runtime per operation for the ArithGrowList compare to that of GeomGrowList and JavaGrowList? Specifically look at the non-accumulated plots and desribe the trends for how long each operation takes as a function of how many elements have already been inserted in the list.
A: Geom and JavaGrowList both have a runtime per operation near 0 (save for where it spikes), while ArithGrowList has a much higher runtime per operation. (close to .5 microseconds)

Q: When are there spikes in the per operation runtime graphs for each of the implementations? Do these make sense to you? Hint: some of these should and others might not. Empirical runtime can be quite messy and depends on machine specifics which will be revealed in other subsequent classes like CS61C.
A: GeomGrowList spikes when it has to double the size of the array, Arith spikes when it has to increase the size of the array.

Q: Optional: Try changing the code for GeomGrowList to resize by a different factor. How does this effect the theoretical asymptotic runtime? How does this effect the plotted runtime?
A:

Q: Optional: Try changing the code for ArithGrowList to resize by adding a different fixed number of spots in the array. How does this effect the theoretical asymptotic runtime? How does this effect the plotted runtime?
A:
